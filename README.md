# seminar_multicore

This repository was originally created at gitlab.lrz.de during the Advanced Practical Course - Efficient Programming of Multicore Systems and Supercomputers(IN2106). 

In our group we programmed a heat calculation algorithm using a stencil calculation to be run parallel at Liebniz Supercomputing Centre (LRZ) with various parallel programming techniques such as:

1. Pthreads
2. OMP
3. MPI

In the end, we had a competition where each student formed teams to parallelize the decision making process of an reduced AI playing GO. Our AI won the inclass-tournament.
